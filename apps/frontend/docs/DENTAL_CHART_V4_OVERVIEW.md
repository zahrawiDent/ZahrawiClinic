# Dental Chart V4 Overview

The V4 experience bundles eruption intelligence, interdisciplinary charting, and treatment planning into a single high-bandwidth screen. It is designed for chairside use with pediatric, mixed, and adult dentitions.

## Feature Highlights

- **Stage Selector** – Jump between primary, mixed, and permanent templates with live eruption metrics.
- **Full Arch Visualizer** – Interactive SVG arch that renders every tooth simultaneously, tinting surfaces for operative findings and stacking badges for crowns, implants, endo, surgery, and extractions.
- **Eruption Board** – Upper/lower arch cards show eruption state, tooth status, and quick controls for each tooth.
- **Specialty Composer** – Tabs for Operative, Fixed/Prosth, Endo, Perio, and Surgery with fast data capture patterns.
- **Treatment Slate** – Track procedure status and ownership directly beside the composer.
- **Insight Cards** – Summaries for eruption coverage, specialty load, and generated clinical cues.

## Usage Tips

1. Select the stage that matches the patient. Stage metrics will update automatically.
2. Click any tooth card to activate the Specialty Composer. Use the surface chips and picklists to add findings.
3. Add a procedure label after recording a condition to keep the treatment slate synchronized with the chart.
4. Use the eruption buttons on each tooth card to record whether eruption is pending, in progress, or complete.
5. Review the cues panel for autogenerated reminders derived from current findings.

## Extending V4

- Add persistence by connecting `handleConditionAdd` and `handleProcedureAdd` to an API mutation.
- Drop additional specialty tabs into `SpecialtyComposer` to cover ortho or airway findings.
- Wire the `ProcedureSlate` status selector to notifications for coordinators.

This version ships in isolation from the legacy charts. You can safely iterate on UX or data contracts without risking regression to earlier implementations.
